email questions

    how do we read the local json file? by hard coding the pathname
    into the ajax (or getJSON) call like in the test client last time,
    or by accepting a user input file name?

    the urls in twitter's documentation examples aren't slash escaped,
    but the ones in the example JSON are. which format are we going
    with?

    can we use jquery UI's autocomplete for the search bar?
