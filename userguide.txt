TEST SITE

    This is a free account so it takes a while to load up the first
    time, because the server goes to sleep when no one's using the
    site, but after that it should be normal:

COMMENT VOTES

    Like topics, comments are also sorted by total votes. This may
    cause confusion when you upvote a post and it doesn't move up,
    because the post above has more __total__votes__ than the current
    post.

VOTING

    Given two sibling posts with the same number of total votes, the
    one most recently voted on will take precedence in relative
    ordering, i.e. if you've just voted on post A, and it now has the
    same number of total votes as post B immediately on top, A will
    rise above B. This aggressive strategy makes voting just a little
    bit more interesting.
