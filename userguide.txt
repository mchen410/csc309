VOTING

    Given two sibling posts with the same number of total votes, the
    one most recently voted on will take precedence in relative
    ordering, i.e. if you've just voted on post A, and it now has the
    same number of total votes as post B immediately on top, A will
    rise above B. This aggressive strategy makes voting just a little
    bit more interesting.
