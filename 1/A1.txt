Ex: To get the title of a topic, from a json return of the entire schema, use 'topics[topicId].title.

The number of votes in the database is stored as a string, so when getting values from the database, make sure to do the appropriate integer conversions to and from strings.


url.com:PORT/ --> goes to index.html

API (the parts of the url that you can/should change are in quotes):
GET
url.com:PORT/topics:
	returns the entire schema

url.com:PORT/topic/"idNum"/"descriptor":
	returns a portion of the entire schema, in JSON format
	idNum refers to the topic id and descriptor refers to the element in topic that you would
	like to retrieve.
	Ex: 	url.com:PORT/topic/0/title  returns  { "title" : "---0's title here---" }
		url.com:PORT/topic/2/votes returns { "votes" : "---0's numvotes here---" }

POST
url.com:PORT/post/topic:
	post topic title and topic link to the nodejs server
	The form must post three chunks of data: the first is the topic title, the second is the
	topic link, and the third is the button submit.

url.com:PORT/post/comment:

	The form must post four chunks of data: the first is the comment text, the second is the
	topic id of the topic the comment belongs to, the third is the id of the parent comment,
	and the fourth should be the button submit.

url.com:PORT/vote/topic/"topicid"
