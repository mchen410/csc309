Our server is accessible at: 
greywolf.cdf.toronto.edu:30975
redwolf.cdf.toronto.edu:31235
redwolf.cdf.toronto.edu: 31390
redwolf.cdf.toronto.edu:31230

(Each of these are using the corresponding member's database, but
are running on the same version of the server. POSTs on one server won't
affect data on the other servers.)

For sending requests with blog names, please use the format:
blogname.tumblr.com (unless the original URL doesn't contain tumblr). We
made this design decision to avoid having to concatinate 'tumblr.com'
when it's not needed.
