TUMBLR API

    http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/replaceface.tumblr.com/likes

        res: response.liked_posts

IMPLEMENTATION

    1   need to keep track of last two note_count's. on the hour poll
        tumblr and update

    2   /blogs/trends can be done by calling /blog/<bh>/trends on all
        blogs in db, sort and limit

    SEPARATE POST TRACKING AND NOTE TRACKING

        track posts every hour by polling blogs to see if there are
        new posts liked by owner

        track note counts by polling posts

TRICKS

    instead of doing everything on the hour, split it up by the minute
    over num posts and num blogs in db. e.g. if there are 60 blogs to
    track, poll one every minute to see if there are new posts. if
    there are 360 posts to track, poll 60 every minute for their note
    counts.

DB SCHEMA

    two db's:

    blogs

        [
            {
                name: <base-hostname>
            }
        ]

    posts

        [
            {
                url: <url>
                date: <date>
                image: <image>
                text: <text>
                note_count_pre: <last note count>
                note_count_cur: <current note count>
                created: <created>
            },
            {
                ...
            }
